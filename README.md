Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple and fun game played between two people. The goal is to be the first to get three of your marks, either X or O, in a straight line—whether that's across a row, down a column, or diagonally—on a 3x3 grid.

When creating this game for the web, you use HTML to set up the basic structure of the grid, CSS to make it look nice, and JavaScript to handle the game's behavior. Players take turns clicking on the squares of the grid, and with each click, JavaScript checks if someone has won or if the game ends in a tie. The game also includes a reset button, so you can easily start a new round. CSS helps ensure the grid is easy to interact with and looks good, making the game both enjoyable to play and visually appealing.
